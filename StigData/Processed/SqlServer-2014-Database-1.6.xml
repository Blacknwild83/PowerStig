      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Without the capability to restrict which roles and individuals can select which events are audited, unauthorized personnel may be able to prevent or interfere with the auditing of critical events.

Suppression of auditing could permit an adversary to evade detection.

Misconfigured audits can degrade the system's performance by overwhelming the audit log. Misconfigured audits may also make it more difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Use of SQL Server Audit is recommended.  All features of SQL Server Audit are available in the Enterprise and Developer editions of SQL Server 2014.  It is not available at the database level in other editions.  For this or legacy reasons, the instance may be using SQL Server Trace for auditing, which remains an acceptable solution for the time being.  Note, however, that Microsoft intends to remove most aspects of Trace at some point after SQL Server 2016.

This version of the requirement deals with SQL Server Audit-based audit trails.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

Obtain the list of approved audit maintainers from the system documentation.

Review the database roles and individual users that have the following permissions, both of which enable the ability to maintain audit definitions:
ALTER ANY DATABASE AUDIT
CONTROL ON DATABASE

The functions and views provided in the supplemental file Permissions.sql can assist in this review.  In the following, "STIG" stands for the schema where you have deployed these views and functions.  To see which logins and server roles have been granted these permissions:
    SELECT
        *
    FROM
        STIG.database_permissions P
    WHERE
        (P.[Permission] = 'ALTER ANY DATABASE AUDIT')
        OR
        (P.[Permission] = 'CONTROL' AND P.[Securable Type or Class] = 'DATABASE')
        ;

To see what users and database roles inherit these permissions from the database roles reported by the previous query, repeat the following for each one:
    SELECT * FROM STIG.members_of_database_role(&lt;database role name&gt;);

To see all the permissions in effect for a database principal (server role or login):
    SELECT * FROM STIG.server_effective_permissions(&lt;principal name&gt;);

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;SQL Server's fixed (built-in) server roles, especially [sysadmin], have powerful capabilities that could cause great harm if misused, so their use must be tightly controlled.

The SQL Server instance uses each database's TRUSTWORTHY property to guard against tampering that could enable unwarranted privilege escalation. When TRUSTWORTHY is 0/False/Off, SQL Server prevents the database from accessing resources in other databases. When TRUSTWORTHY is 1/True/On, SQL Server permits access to other databases (subject to other protections). SQL Server sets TRUSTWORTHY OFF when it creates a new database. SQL Server forces TRUSTWORTHY OFF, irrespective of its prior value, when an existing database is attached to it, to address the possibility that an adversary may have tampered with the database, introducing malicious code. To set TRUSTWORTHY ON, an account with the [sysadmin] role must issue an ALTER DATABASE command.

Although SQL Server itself treats this property conservatively, application installer programs may set TRUSTWORTHY ON and leave it on. This provides an opportunity for misuse.

When TRUSTWORTHY is ON, users of the database can take advantage of the database owner's privileges, by impersonating the owner. This can have particularly serious consequences if the database owner is the [sa] login (which may have been renamed in accordance with SQL4-00-010200, and disabled in accordance with SQL4-00-017100, but nonetheless can be invoked in an EXECUTE AS USER = 'dbo' statement, or CREATE PROCEDURE ... WITH EXECUTE AS OWNER ...). The [sa] login cannot be removed from the [sysadmin] role. The user impersonating [sa] - or another [sysadmin] account - is then able to perform administrative actions across all databases under the instance, including making any himself or any other login a member of [sysadmin].

Most of the other fixed server roles could be similarly abused.

Therefore, TRUSTWORTHY must not be used on databases owned by logins that are members of the fixed server roles. Further, if TRUSTWORTHY is to be used for any other database, the need must be documented and approved.

The system database [msdb] is an exception: it is required to be TRUSTWORTHY.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Invalid user input occurs when a user inserts data or characters into an application’s data entry fields and the application is unprepared to process that data. This results in unanticipated application behavior potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.

SQL Server needs to validate the data user’s attempt to input to the application for processing. Rules for checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, acceptable values) are in place to verify inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Inputs passed to interpreters are prescreened to prevent the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands.

A poorly designed database system can have many problems. A common issue with these types of systems is the missed opportunity to use constraints.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Databases holding data requiring "data at rest" protections must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the information at rest. These cryptographic mechanisms may be native to the DBMS or implemented via additional software or operating system/file system settings, as appropriate to the situation.

Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).

For this or legacy reasons, the instance may be using SQL Server Trace for auditing, which remains an acceptable solution for the time being.  Note, however, that Microsoft intends to remove most aspects of Trace at some point after SQL Server 2016.  Note also that Trace does not support auditing of SELECT statements, whereas Audit does.

Since Trace does not provide for tracking SELECT statements, it is necessary to provide this tracking at the application level, if Trace is used for audit purposes.

Use of SQL Server Audit's SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP causes capture of all accesses, successful and otherwise, to all schema-scoped objects.  The [Succeeded] column in the audit output indicates the success or failure of the attempted action.  Be aware, however, that it may report True in some cases where one would intuitively expect False.  For example, SELECT 1/0 FROM SYS.ALL_OBJECTS will appear in the audit trail as successful, if the user has permission to perform that action, even though it contains an invalid expression.  Some other actions that one would consider failures (such as selecting from a table that does not exist) may not appear at all.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

If neither SQL Server Audit nor SQL Server Trace is in use for audit purposes, this is a finding.

If SQL Server Trace is in use for audit purposes, review the Trace settings, and the triggers on the tables holding categorized information, to determine whether all UPDATE actions on these tables are traced, including failed attempts.  If not, this is a finding.

Check to see that all required event classes are being audited.  From the query prompt:
SELECT * FROM sys.traces;

All currently defined traces for the SQL server instance will be listed. If no traces are returned, this is a finding.

Determine the trace(s) being used for the auditing requirement.
In the following, replace # with a trace ID being used for the auditing requirements.
From the query prompt:
SELECT DISTINCT(eventid) FROM sys.fn_trace_geteventinfo(#);

The following required event IDs should be among those listed; if not, this is a finding:

82-91  -- User-defined Event (at least one of these, matching the triggers; 90 is used in the supplied script)
162 -- User error message


If SQL Server Audit is in use, proceed as follows.

The basic SQL Server Audit configuration provided in the supplemental file Audit.sql uses the broad, server-level audit action group SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP for this purpose.  SQL Server Audit's flexibility makes other techniques possible.  If an alternative technique is in use and demonstrated effective, this is not a finding.

Determine the name(s) of the server audit specification(s) in use.
To look at audits and audit specifications, in Management Studio's object explorer, expand 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Audits
and
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Server Audit Specifications.
Also, 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Databases &gt;&gt; &lt;database name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Database Audit Specifications.
Alternatively, review the contents of the system views with "audit" in their names.

Run the following to verify that all SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE actions on tables and views are being audited:
USE [master];
GO
SELECT * FROM sys.server_audit_specification_details WHERE server_specification_id =
(SELECT server_specification_id FROM sys.server_audit_specifications WHERE [name] = '&lt;server_audit_specification_name&gt;')
AND audit_action_name = 'SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP';

If no row is returned, this is a finding.

If the audited_result column is not "SUCCESS" or "SUCCESS AND FAILURE", this is a finding.</RawString>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;SQL Server's fixed (built-in) server roles, especially [sysadmin], have powerful capabilities that could cause great harm if misused, so their use must be tightly controlled.

The SQL Server instance uses each database's TRUSTWORTHY property to guard against tampering that could enable unwarranted privilege escalation. When TRUSTWORTHY is 0/False/Off, SQL Server prevents the database from accessing resources in other databases. When TRUSTWORTHY is 1/True/On, SQL Server permits access to other databases (subject to other protections). SQL Server sets TRUSTWORTHY OFF when it creates a new database. SQL Server forces TRUSTWORTHY OFF, irrespective of its prior value, when an existing database is attached to it, to address the possibility that an adversary may have tampered with the database, introducing malicious code. To set TRUSTWORTHY ON, an account with the [sysadmin] role must issue an ALTER DATABASE command.

Although SQL Server itself treats this property conservatively, application installer programs may set TRUSTWORTHY ON and leave it on. This provides an opportunity for misuse.

When TRUSTWORTHY is ON, users of the database can take advantage of the database owner's privileges, by impersonating the owner. This can have particularly serious consequences if the database owner is the [sa] login (which may have been renamed in accordance with SQL4-00-010200, and disabled in accordance with SQL4-00-017100, but nonetheless can be invoked in an EXECUTE AS USER = 'dbo' statement, or CREATE PROCEDURE ... WITH EXECUTE AS OWNER ...). The [sa] login cannot be removed from the [sysadmin] role. The user impersonating [sa] - or another [sysadmin] account - is then able to perform administrative actions across all databases under the instance, including making any himself or any other login a member of [sysadmin].

Most of the other fixed server roles could be similarly abused.

Therefore, TRUSTWORTHY must not be used on databases owned by logins that are members of the fixed server roles. Further, if TRUSTWORTHY is to be used for any other database, the need must be documented and approved.

The system database [msdb] is an exception: it is required to be TRUSTWORTHY.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

Use strongly typed data items rather than general-purpose strings as input parameters to task-specific, pre-compiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers).

When dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which should be implemented both in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures:
-- Allow strings as input only when necessary. 
-- Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted.
-- Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary.
-- If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equals signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them.
-- If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. In SQL, these are -- or /* */ 
-- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them.
-- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word ESCAPE is also a clue that wildcards are in use.
-- If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, MODIFY will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly Grant (as a person's name), could also be valid input. 
-- If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits.
-- Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the developer.
-- Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use.
-- Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation.
-- Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways. Not only can the caller be subject to such vulnerabilities; it may itself be the attacker.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Any DBMS or associated application providing too much information in error messages on the screen or printout risks compromising the data and security of the system. The structure and content of error messages need to be carefully considered by the organization and development team.

Databases can inadvertently provide a wealth of information to an attacker through improperly handled error messages. In addition to sensitive business or personal information, database errors can provide host names, IP addresses, user names, and other system information not required for end-user troubleshooting but very useful to someone targeting the system.

Carefully consider the structure/content of error messages. The extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements. Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes, for example, logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as the username, mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated explicitly by) information recorded, and personal information, such as account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers.

It is important that detailed error messages be visible only to those who are authorized to view them; that general users receive only generalized acknowledgment that errors have occurred; and that these generalized messages appear only when relevant to the user's task. For example, a message along the lines of, "An error has occurred. Unable to save your changes. If this problem persists, please contact your help desk" would be relevant. A message such as "Warning: your transaction generated a large number of page splits" would likely not be relevant. "ABGQ is not a valid widget code" would be appropriate; but "The INSERT statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "WidgetTransactionFK". The conflict occurred in database "DB7", table "dbo.WidgetMaster", column 'WidgetCode'" would not, as it reveals too much about the database structure.

"ABGQ is not a valid widget code" would be appropriate; but "The INSERT statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "WidgetTransactionFK". The conflict occurred in database "DB7", table "dbo.WidgetMaster", column 'WidgetCode'" would not, as it reveals too much about the database structure.

Administrative users authorized to review detailed error messages typically are the ISSO, ISSM, SA and DBA. Other individuals or roles may be specified according to organization-specific needs, with appropriate approval.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

Security labels are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of an entity (e.g., subjects and objects) with respect to safeguarding information. 

These labels are typically associated with internal data structures (e.g., tables, rows) within the database and are used to enable the implementation of access control and flow control policies, reflect special dissemination, handling or distribution instructions, or support other aspects of the information security policy. 

One example includes marking data as classified or FOUO.

If the security labels are lost when the data is stored, there is the risk of a data compromise.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;If time stamps are not consistently applied and there is no common time reference, it is difficult to perform forensic analysis, in audit files, trace files/tables, and application data tables.

Time stamps generated by SQL Server must include date and time, to a granularity of one second or finer. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time measurements refers to the precision available in time stamp values. Granularity coarser than one second is not sufficient for audit trail purposes, and granularity finer than one second is recommended. Time stamp values are typically presented with three or more decimal places of seconds; however, the actual granularity may be coarser than the apparent precision. For example, SQL Server's GETDATE()/CURRENT_TMESTAMP values are presented to three decimal places, but the granularity is not one millisecond: it is about 1/300 of a second. 

The data types that can be used for this purpose in SQL Server are:
DATETIME2 - precision variable from a whole second down to a ten-millionth (subject to the actual precision of the hardware and operating system)
DATETIMEOFFSET - as datetime2, together with local offset from UTC
DATE, together with TIME (same precision considerations as for datetime2)
DATETIME - precision 1/300 of a second
Character-string data types allowing for at least 20 characters are also permissible, but not recommended.

SQL Server built-in functions for retrieving current timestamps are:  (high precision) sysdatetime(), sysdatetimeoffset(), sysutcdatetime();  (lower precision) CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or getdate(), getutcdate().

Ensure that values recorded for tracking purposes in data tables are correctly defined and maintained.  (Design decisions about which tables require audit-trail or activity-tracking columns are outside the scope of this STIG.  This requirement applies only to the data type and maintenance of such columns if they do exist.)

The SMALLDATETIME data type is not precise enough for this purpose.  Although it gives the impression of including a seconds component, the seconds value is always "00".

SQL Server offers a data type called TIMESTAMP that is not a representation of date and time. Rather, it is a database state counter and does not correspond to calendar and clock time. This requirement does not refer to that meaning of TIMESTAMP.  To avoid confusion, Microsoft recommends using the newer name for this data type, ROWVERSION, instead.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

The basic SQL Server Audit configuration provided in the supplemental file Audit.sql uses the server-level audit action group SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP for this purpose.  SQL Server Audit's flexibility makes other techniques possible.  If an alternative technique is in use and demonstrated effective, this is not a finding.

Determine the name(s) of the server audit specification(s) in use.

To look at audits and audit specifications, in Management Studio's object explorer, expand 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Audits
and
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Server Audit Specifications.
Also, 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Databases &gt;&gt; &lt;database name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Database Audit Specifications.

Alternatively, review the contents of the system views with "audit" in their names.

Run the following to verify that all logons and connections are being audited:
USE [master];
GO
SELECT * FROM sys.server_audit_specification_details WHERE server_specification_id =
(SELECT server_specification_id FROM sys.server_audit_specifications WHERE [name] = '&lt;server_audit_specification_name&gt;')
AND audit_action_name = 'SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP';
GO

If no row is returned, this is a finding.

If the audited_result column is not "SUCCESS" or "SUCCESS AND FAILURE", this is a finding.</RawString>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;This control is intended to address the confidentiality and integrity of information at rest in non-mobile devices and covers user information and system information.  Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g., disk drive, tape drive) within an organizational information system. Applications and application users generate information throughout the course of their application use.

User-generated data, as well as, application-specific configuration data, needs to be protected. Configurations and/or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator content are examples of system information likely requiring protection. Organizations may choose to employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, as appropriate.

If the confidentiality and integrity of SQL Server data is not protected, the data will be open to compromise and unauthorized modification.

Protective measures include encryption, physical security of the facility where the storage devices reside, operating system file permissions, and organizational controls.  Each of these should be applied as necessary and appropriate.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Authentication with a DoD-approved PKI certificate does not necessarily imply authorization to access the database and all its contents.  To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including SQL Server databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies. 

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. 

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.

This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes SQL Server.  If SQL Server is not configured to follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., network interface, hard disk, modem, etc.). From an application perspective, certain specific application functionalities may be audited as well.

The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records.  Examples are auditable events, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.

Organizations define which application components shall provide auditable events.

The DBMS must provide auditing for the list of events defined by the organization or risk negatively impacting forensic investigations into malicious behavior in the information system.

Use of SQL Server Audit is recommended.  All features of SQL Server Audit are available in the Enterprise and Developer editions of SQL Server 2014.  It is not available at the database level in other editions.  For this or legacy reasons, the instance may be using SQL Server Trace for auditing, which remains an acceptable solution for the time being.

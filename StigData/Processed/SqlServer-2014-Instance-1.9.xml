      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect devices on an organizationâ€™s internal network from being directly affected by DoS attacks.

One way SQL Server can limit exposure to DoS attacks is to restrict the number of connections that can be opened by a single user. SQL Server supports this through the use of logon triggers. (Note, however, that this need not be the only, or even the principal, means for satisfying this requirement. Depending on the architecture and capabilities of the network and application, a network device or an application may be more suitable for providing this protection.)

When determining the appropriate values for this limit, take the characteristics of the various kinds of user into account, and bear in mind that some applications and some users may need to have multiple sessions open. For example, while a standard account using a simple application may never need more than, say, five connections, a database administrator using SQL Server Management Studio may need significantly more, because each tab in that application counts as a distinct session.

Architectural note: In SQL Server, a count of active sessions by user can be obtained from one of the dynamic management views. For example:
      SELECT original_login_name, count(*)
      FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
      WHERE is_user_process = 1
      GROUP BY original_login_name;
However, for this to return an accurate count in a logon trigger, the user would have to have the View Server State privilege. (Without this privilege, the trigger sees information only about the current session, so would always return a count of one.) View Server State would give that user access to a wide swath of information about the server.  One way to avoid this exposure is to create a summary table, and a view of that table that restricts each user to seeing his/her own count, and establish a frequently-run background job to refresh the table (using the above query or similar). The logon trigger then queries the view to obtain a count that is accurate enough for this purpose in most circumstances.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <RawString>Review the system documentation to determine whether any limits have been defined. If not, this is a finding.

If one limit has been defined but is not applied to all users, including privileged administrative accounts, this is a finding.

If multiple limits have been defined, to accommodate different types of user, verify that together they cover all users. If not, this is a finding.

If a mechanism other than a logon trigger is used, verify its correct operation by the appropriate means.

If it does not work correctly, this is a finding.

Otherwise, determine if a logon trigger exists:

EITHER, in SQL Server Management Studio's Object Explorer tree:
Expand [SQL Server Instance] &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Server Objects &gt;&gt; Triggers

OR run the query:
SELECT * FROM master.sys.server_triggers;

If no triggers are listed, this is a finding.

If triggers are listed, identify the one(s) limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user.

If none are found, this is a finding.

If they are present but disabled, this is a finding.

Examine the trigger source code for logical correctness and for compliance with the documented limit(s).

If errors or variances exist, this is a finding.

Verify that the system does execute the trigger(s) each time a user session is established.

If it does not operate correctly for all types of user, this is a finding.</RawString>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Enterprise environments make account management for applications and databases challenging and complex. A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization.

A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. 

Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.

Account management and authentication in a Windows environment normally use an LDAP-compatible directory service, usually Windows Active Directory.  This in turn, in the DoD environment, is typically integrated with the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  Additional technologies or products may be employed that when placed together constitute an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.  An example is the use of Group Policy Objects to enforce rules concerning passwords.

SQL Server must be configured to use Windows authentication, with SQL Server authentication disabled.  If circumstances (such as the architecture of a purchased application) make it necessary to have SQL Server authentication available, its use must be kept to a minimum.  The reasons for its use, and the measures taken to restrict it to only the necessary cases, must be documented, with AO approval.

It is assumed throughout this STIG that this integration has been implemented.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Non-repudiation of actions taken is required in order to maintain application integrity. Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include creating information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract), and receiving a message.

Non-repudiation protects against later claims by a user of not having created, modified, or deleted a particular data item or collection of data in the database.

Use of shared accounts does not provide individual accountability for actions taken on the DBMS or data. Whenever a single database account is used to connect to the database, a secondary authentication method that provides individual accountability is required. This scenario most frequently occurs when an externally hosted application authenticates individual users to the application and the application uses a single account to retrieve or update database information on behalf of the individual users (as in connection pooling).

When shared accounts are utilized without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;SQL Server auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Audit record content which may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes:  time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.

SQL Server does have a means available to add organizationally defined additional, more detailed information in the audit event records. These events may be identified by type, location, or subject. An example of more detailed information the organization may require in audit records could be the name of the application where the request is coming from.

Some organizations may determine that more detailed information is required for specific database event types. If this information is not available, it could negatively impact forensic investigations into user actions or other malicious events.

When availability is an overriding concern, approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows:

(ii) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the DBMS must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The SQL Server Browser simplifies the administration of SQL Server, particularly when multiple instances of SQL Server coexist on the same computer.  It avoids the need to hard-assign port numbers to the instances and to set and maintain those port numbers in client systems.  It enables administrators and authorized users to discover database management system instances, and the databases they support, over the network.

This convenience also presents the possibility of unauthorized individuals gaining knowledge of the available SQL Server resources.  Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the SQL Server Browser is needed.  Typically, if only a single instance is installed, using the default name (MSSQLSERVER) and port assignment (1433), the Browser is not adding any value.   The more complex the installation, the more likely SQL Server Browser is to be helpful.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Audit record content which may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to:  time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.

SQL Server is capable of a range of actions on data stored within the database. It is important, for accurate forensic analysis, to know the outcome of attempted actions. This requires specific information regarding the outcome of the action or event that the audit record is referring to. If outcome status information is not recorded and stored with the audit record, the record itself is of very limited use.

Success and failure indicators ascertain the outcome of a particular event. As such, they also provide a means to measure the impact of an event and help authorized personnel to determine the appropriate response. Without knowing the outcome of audit events, it is very difficult to accurately recreate the series of events during forensic analysis.

Use of SQL Server Audit is recommended.  All features of SQL Server Audit are available in the Enterprise and Developer editions of SQL Server 2014.  It is not available at the database level in other editions.  For this or legacy reasons, the instance may be using SQL Server Trace for auditing, which remains an acceptable solution for the time being.  Note, however, that Microsoft intends to remove most aspects of Trace at some point after SQL Server 2016.

If Trace is enabled for auditing, SQL Server does capture the outcome status information in all audit records.

If SQL Server Audit is enabled, the [Succeeded] column in the audit output indicates the success or failure of the attempted action.  Be aware, however, that it may report True in some cases where one would intuitively expect False.  For example, SELECT 1/0 FROM SYS.ALL_OBJECTS will appear in the audit trail as successful, if the user has permission to perform that action, even though it contains an invalid expression.  Some other actions that one would consider failures (such as selecting from a table that does not exist) may not appear at all.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;If audit data were to become compromised, competent forensic analysis and discovery of the true source of potentially malicious system activity would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. In addition, access to audit records provides information an attacker could potentially use to his or her advantage.

To ensure the veracity of audit data, the information system and/or the application must protect audit information from any and all unauthorized access. This includes read, write, copy, etc.

SQL Server and third-party tools are examples of applications that are easily able to view and manipulate audit file data. Additionally, applications with user interfaces to audit records should not allow unfettered manipulation of, or access to, those records via any application. If an application provides access to the audit data, the application becomes accountable for ensuring that audit information is protected from unauthorized access.

This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods, which will depend upon system architecture and design. Some commonly employed methods include ensuring log files enjoy the proper file system permissions utilizing file system protections, and limiting log data location.

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

Note 1: It is highly advisable to use a separate account for each service. When installing SQL Server in single-server mode, you can opt to have these provisioned for you. These automatically-generated accounts are referred to as virtual accounts. Each virtual account has an equivalent Service SID, with the same name. The installer also creates an equivalent SQL Server login, also with the same name. Applying folder and file permissions to Service SIDs, rather than to domain accounts or local computer accounts, provides tighter control, because these permissions are available only to the specific service when it is running, and not in any other context. (However, when using failover clustering, a domain account must be specified at installation, rather than a virtual account.)

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;When dealing with change control issues, it should be noted, any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the information system and/or application can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the system.

Multiple applications can provide a cumulative negative effect. A vulnerability and subsequent exploit of one application can lead to an exploit of other applications sharing the same security context. For example, an exploit of a web server process that leads to unauthorized administrative access to host system directories can most likely lead to a compromise of all applications hosted by the same system.

      <RawString>Verify the SQL Server installations present on the server.

From a Command Prompt, type regedit.exe, and press [ENTER].

Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt;&gt; SOFTWARE &gt;&gt; Microsoft &gt;&gt; Microsoft SQL Server &gt;&gt; Instance Names. Each instance installed on the server possesses a key inside a folder under this registry entry.

Analysis Services Instances are registered in the OLAP subfolder.
Reporting Services Instances are registered in the RS subfolder.
Standard SQL Server (database engine) Instances are registered in the SQL subfolder.

Inside each one of these folders, a single key is used to reference an Instance's specific Windows Registry tree. Each key will have its own registry tree at the following registry location: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt;&gt; SOFTWARE &gt;&gt; Microsoft &gt;&gt; Microsoft SQL Server &gt;&gt; [INSTANCE NAME].

An [INSTANCE NAME] is listed as the Data component of a key found in one of the above OLAP, RS, or SQL folders.

To find the installation location of a particular instance, navigate to the following location in the Windows Registry:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt;&gt; SOFTWARE &gt;&gt; Microsoft &gt;&gt; Microsoft SQL Server &gt;&gt; [INSTANCE NAME] &gt;&gt; Setup. Examine the value of the 'SqlProgramDir' key. The value of the 'SqlProgramDir' key is the SQL Server installation directory for that SQL Server Instance.

Navigate to that folder location using a Command Prompt or Windows Explorer. Only applications that are required for the functioning and administration, not use, of SQL Server should be located on the same directory node as the SQL Server software libraries.

If any files or subfolders that are not part of the SQL Server installation are in the folder, this is a finding.</RawString>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).

Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component of an information system (e.g., email and web services) but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.

To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the application must support the organizational requirements providing only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life issues.

Database Management Systems using ports, protocols, and services deemed unsafe are open to attack through those ports, protocols, and services. This can allow unauthorized access to the database and, through the database, to other components of the information system.

Obfuscation of user-provided information when typed into the system is a method used in addressing this risk.

For example, displaying asterisks when a user types in a password or PIN, is an example of obscuring feedback of authentication information.

Weak cryptography could allow an attacker to gain access to and modify data stored in the database as well as the administration settings of SQL Server.

Applications, including DBMSs, utilizing cryptography are required to use approved NIST FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Authentication with a DoD-approved PKI certificate does not necessarily imply authorization to access the SQL Server instance and server-level resources.  To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including SQL Server instances, must be properly configured to implement access control policies. 

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. 

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system. 

This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes SQL Server.  If SQL Server is not configured to follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;An isolation boundary provides access control and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform security functions. 

Security functions are defined as "the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based".

Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles.

Database Management Systems typically separate security functionality from nonsecurity functionality via separate databases or schemas.  SQL Server's [master] database and [sys] schema are examples of this.  Further granularity of access protection is provided by assigning logins and users to appropriate server roles and database roles

Database objects or code implementing security functionality should not be commingled with objects or code implementing application logic.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access to information or privileges. 

System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged.

Depending on circumstances, privileged functions can include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.

A privileged function in the DBMS/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In SQL Server, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to: 
CREATE
ALTER
DROP
GRANT
REVOKE
DENY

There may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples include:

TRUNCATE TABLE;
DELETE, or
DELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
DELETE without a WHERE clause;

UPDATE or
UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
UPDATE without a WHERE clause;

any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal.

Depending on the design of the database and associated applications, the prevention of unauthorized use of privileged functions may be achieved by means of DBMS security features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

The nature and requirements of databases will vary; so while users are not permitted to install unapproved software, there may be instances where the organization allows the user to install approved software packages such as from an approved software repository. The requirements for production servers will be more restrictive than those used for development and research.

SQL Server must control software installation by users based upon what types of software installations are permitted (e.g., updates and security patches to existing software) and what types of installations are prohibited (e.g., software whose pedigree with regard to being potentially malicious is unknown or suspect) by the organization). 

In the case of a database management system, this requirement covers stored procedures, functions, triggers, views, etc.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Without auditing the enforcement of access restrictions against changes to configuration, it would be difficult to identify attempted attacks and an audit trail would not be available for forensic investigation for after-the-fact actions. 

Enforcement actions are the methods or mechanisms used to prevent unauthorized changes to configuration settings. Enforcement action methods may be as simple as denying access to a file based on the application of file permissions (access restriction). Audit items may consist of lists of actions blocked by access restrictions or changes identified after the fact.

Use of SQL Server Audit is recommended.  All features of SQL Server Audit are available in the Enterprise and Developer editions of SQL Server 2014.

If SQL Server Audit is in use, proceed as follows.

The basic SQL Server Audit configuration provided in the supplemental file Audit.sql uses broad, server-level audit action groups for this purpose.  SQL Server Audit's flexibility makes other techniques possible.  If an alternative technique is in use and demonstrated effective, this is not a finding.

Determine the name(s) of the server audit specification(s) in use.

To look at audits and audit specifications, in Management Studio's object explorer, expand 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Audits
and
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Server Audit Specifications.
Also, 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Databases &gt;&gt; &lt;database name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Database Audit Specifications.

Alternatively, review the contents of the system views with "audit" in their names.

Run the following code to verify that all configuration-related actions are being audited:
USE [master];
GO
SELECT * FROM sys.server_audit_specification_details WHERE server_specification_id =
(SELECT server_specification_id FROM sys.server_audit_specifications WHERE [name] = '&lt;server_audit_specification_name&gt;')
AND audit_action_name IN

      <RawString>If neither SQL Server Audit nor SQL Server Trace is in use for audit purposes, this is a finding.

Obtain the list of locally-defined security tables, procedures and functions (if any) that require tracking.

If SQL Server Trace is in use for audit purposes, verify that all required events are being audited.  From the query prompt:

All currently defined traces for the SQL server instance will be listed.

In the following, replace # with a trace ID being used for the auditing requirements.

If SQL Server Audit is in use, proceed as follows.

The basic SQL Server Audit configuration provided in the supplemental file Audit.sql uses broad, server-level audit action groups for this purpose.  SQL Server Audit's flexibility makes other techniques possible.  If an alternative technique is in use and demonstrated effective, this is not a finding.

Determine the name(s) of the server audit specification(s) in use.

To look at audits and audit specifications, in Management Studio's object explorer, expand 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Audits
and
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Server Audit Specifications.
Also, 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Databases &gt;&gt; &lt;database name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Database Audit Specifications.

Alternatively, review the contents of the system views with "audit" in their names.

Run the following code to verify that all GRANT, ALTER SERVER ROLE . . . ADD MEMBER . . .,  and/or  ALTER ROLE . . . ADD MEMBER . . .  actions, all INSERT and UPDATE actions on any locally-defined permissions tables, and all EXECUTE actions on any system or locally-defined permissions-related procedures and functions, are being audited:
USE [master];
GO
SELECT * FROM sys.server_audit_specification_details WHERE server_specification_id =

'SERVER_PERMISSION_CHANGE_GROUP',
'SERVER_ROLE_MEMBER_CHANGE_GROUP',
'SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP'
);
GO

Examine the list produced by the query.

If any locally-defined permissions tables, procedures, or functions exist, and the list does not include the audit action group SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP, this is a finding.

If any of the other audit action groups specified in the WHERE clause are not included in the list, this is a finding.

      <RawString>If neither SQL Server Audit nor SQL Server Trace is in use for audit purposes, this is a finding.

Obtain the list of locally-defined security tables (if any) that require tracking of Insert-Update-Delete operations.

If SQL Server Trace is in use for audit purposes, review these tables for the existence of triggers to raise a custom event on each Insert-Update-Delete operation.

If such triggers are not present, this is a finding.

Check to see that all required events are being audited.  From the query prompt:
SELECT * FROM sys.traces; 

All currently defined traces for the SQL server instance will be listed.

If no traces are returned, this is a finding.

If SQL Server Audit is in use, proceed as follows.

The basic SQL Server Audit configuration provided in the supplemental file Audit.sql uses broad, server-level audit action groups for this purpose.  SQL Server Audit's flexibility makes other techniques possible.  If an alternative technique is in use and demonstrated effective, this is not a finding.

Determine the name(s) of the server audit specification(s) in use.

To look at audits and audit specifications, in Management Studio's object explorer, expand 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Audits
and
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Server Audit Specifications.
Also, 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Databases &gt;&gt; &lt;database name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Database Audit Specifications.

Alternatively, review the contents of the system views with "audit" in their names.

Run the following code to verify that all GRANT, ALTER SERVER ROLE . . . ADD MEMBER . . .,  and/or  ALTER ROLE . . . ADD MEMBER . . .  actions, all INSERT and UPDATE actions on any locally-defined permissions tables, and all EXECUTE actions on any system or locally-defined permissions-related procedures and functions, are being audited:
USE [master];

Examine the list produced by the query.

If any locally-defined permissions tables, procedures, or functions exist, and the list does not include the audit action group SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP, this is a finding.

If any of the other audit action groups specified in the WHERE clause are not included in the list, this is a finding.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Changes in the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized elevation or restriction of privileges could go undetected. Elevated privileges give users access to information and functionality that they should not have; restricted privileges wrongly deny access to authorized users.

In SQL Server, deleting permissions is typically done via the REVOKE or DENY command; or with the ALTER SERVER ROLE . . . DROP MEMBER . . . and/or ALTER ROLE . . . DROP MEMBER . . . statements.

To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones.

If SQL Server Audit is in use, proceed as follows.

SQL Server Audit's flexibility makes other techniques possible.  If an alternative technique is in use and demonstrated effective, this is not a finding.

Determine the name(s) of the server audit specification(s) in use.

To look at audits and audit specifications, in Management Studio's object explorer, expand 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Audits
and
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Server Audit Specifications.
Also, 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Databases &gt;&gt; &lt;database name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Database Audit Specifications.

Alternatively, review the contents of the system views with "audit" in their names.

Run the following to verify that all logons and connections are being audited:
USE [master];
GO
SELECT * FROM sys.server_audit_specification_details WHERE server_specification_id =
(SELECT server_specification_id FROM sys.server_audit_specifications WHERE [name] = '&lt;server_audit_specification_name&gt;')

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Without tracking privileged activity, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one. 

System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged.

A privileged function in this context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. This encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to:

There may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples in SQL include:

TRUNCATE TABLE;
DELETE, or
DELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
DELETE without a WHERE clause;

UPDATE or
UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
UPDATE without a WHERE clause;

any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal.

      <RawString>If neither SQL Server Audit nor SQL Server Trace is in use for audit purposes, this is a finding.

If SQL Server Trace is in use for audit purposes, verify that all required events are being audited.  From the query prompt:
SELECT * FROM sys.traces;
All currently defined traces for the SQL server instance will be listed.

If no traces are returned, this is a finding.

Determine the trace(s) being used for the auditing requirement.
In the following, replace # with a trace ID being used for the auditing requirements.
From the query prompt:
SELECT DISTINCT(eventid) FROM sys.fn_trace_geteventinfo(#);

The following required event IDs should all be among those listed; if not, this is a finding:

46  -- Object:Created
47  -- Object:Deleted
82-91  -- User-defined Event (required only where there are locally-defined auditable actions)
115  -- Audit Backup/Restore Event
116  -- Audit DBCC Event
117  -- Audit Change Audit Event
118  -- Audit Object Derived Permission Event
128  -- Audit Database Management Event
129  -- Audit Database Object Management Event
130  -- Audit Database Principal Management Event
131  -- Audit Schema Object Management Event
164  -- Object:Altered
170  -- Audit Server Scope GDR Event
171  -- Audit Server Object GDR Event
172  -- Audit Database Object GDR Event
173  -- Audit Server Operation Event
175  -- Audit Server Alter Trace Event
176  -- Audit Server Object Management Event
177  -- Audit Server Principal Management Event

From the system security plan, obtain the list of any other actions considered privileged.  For each, verify that event IDs (and triggers, where necessary) have been defined to capture audit information for these.

If they have not been defined to capture audit information, this is a finding.


If SQL Server Audit is in use, proceed as follows.

The basic SQL Server Audit configuration provided in the supplemental file Audit.sql uses broad, server-level audit action groups for this purpose.  SQL Server Audit's flexibility makes other techniques possible.  If an alternative technique is in use and demonstrated effective, this is not a finding.

Determine the name(s) of the server audit specification(s) in use.

To look at audits and audit specifications, in Management Studio's object explorer, expand 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Audits
and
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Server Audit Specifications.
Also, 
&lt;server name&gt; &gt;&gt; Databases &gt;&gt; &lt;database name&gt; &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Database Audit Specifications.

Alternatively, review the contents of the system views with "audit" in their names.

Run the following code to verify that all configuration-related actions are being audited:
USE [master];
GO
SELECT * FROM sys.server_audit_specification_details WHERE server_specification_id =
(SELECT server_specification_id FROM sys.server_audit_specifications WHERE [name] = '&lt;server_audit_specification_name&gt;');
GO

Examine the list produced by the query..

If the audited_result column is not  "FAILURE" or "SUCCESS AND FAILURE" on every row, this is a finding.

If any of the audit action groups listed below is not included in the query results, this is a finding.

If there are locally-defined privileged activities not encompassed by the list below and not tracked in any other way, this is a finding.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;For completeness of forensic analysis, it is necessary to track who logs on to SQL Server.

Concurrent connections by the same user from multiple workstations may be valid use of the system; or such connections may be due to improper circumvention of the requirement to use the CAC for authentication; or they may indicate unauthorized account sharing; or they may be because an account has been compromised.

If the fact of multiple, concurrent logons by a given user can be reliably reconstructed from the log entries for other events (logons/connections; voluntary and involuntary disconnections), then it is not mandatory to create additional log entries specifically for this.

Use of SQL Server Audit is recommended.  All features of SQL Server Audit are available in the Enterprise and Developer editions of SQL Server 2014.  It is not available at the database level in other editions.  For this or legacy reasons, the instance may be using SQL Server Trace for auditing, which remains an acceptable solution for the time being.
